Displaying two visualisations of DDR1 bound to dasatinib using UCSF Chimera
PDB reference: 5BVW
Magnification adjusted using Side View
Figure 1:
- protein (Select -> Structure -> protein) colour set using Tools -> Depiction -> Color Secondary Structure leaving colours as defaults (helixes in orange-red, strands in purple, coils in grey)
- ligand displayed as spheres (Select -> Structure -> ligand, Actions -> Atoms/Bonds -> sphere
- manually rotated to show ligand-protein binding
- Presets -> Publication 3 used; coils hard to see, so changed colour to medium blue (Select -> Structure -> secondary structure -> coil, Actions -> Color -> medium blue)
- Session saved as Session_part_1.py in H:/CHY8825/DL1
- Image saved as DDR1_dasatinib_structure.png in the same folder
Figure 2:
- manually rotated and magnified using Side View to display binding pocket
- ligand dispayed as ball and stick (selected as above, Actions -> Atoms/Bonds -> ball and stick)
- solvent molecules hidden (Select -> Structure -> solvent, Actions -> Atoms/Bonds -> hide)
- hydrogen bonds found and displayed (Tools -> Surface/Binding Analysis -> FindHBond, all options save Relax H-bond Constraints deselected)
- Labelled atoms and residues forming H-bonds (manually selected atoms, then Actions -> Label -> name, Actions -> Label -> residue -> name) and recoloured labels to aid readability (select labelled object, then Actions -> Color -> all options)
